      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
	  In our Songbird Neuroethology Lab, we often use operant conditioning procedure to study auditory perception i.e. how do birds perceive various vocalizations/sounds? In an operant study, 
	  birds are trained to respond to specific vocalizations using food reinforcement i.e. birds discriminate among vocalization categories. In previous studies of our lab, birds used to get 1 sec
	  of food access after correct response (correct option depending on research question). In the current study, I investigated the effect of doubling the feed time duration on discrimination performance.

			<h2>What?</h2>
			<p>
				Zebra finches discriminated female distance calls from male distance calls. We compared discrimination performance of birds who got food acess of 2 sec vs 1 sec. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div slot="column-2-body">
			<h2>Why?</h2>
			<p> Food time duration plays crucial role for motivation and animal-wellbeing during an experiment. Understanding it's effect on experimental results will help improving animal walfare.

		</div>
		<div slot="column-3-body">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				There was no significant difference in discri per between 2 sec and 1 sec  group birds.
